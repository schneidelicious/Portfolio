                    <p style="font-size: 20px; ">My name is Alex Schneider. The slav on the left is not me. Even before I bribed the principal to let me
                      walk the stage on graduation day, I knew that for me, college would be a road to nowhere. Not even a week after the diploma was in my hand, I was on the sales floor at a car dealership taking ups
                      and becoming a sponge for any knowledge that would result in more deals and less wasted time. Fast forward 10 months and I was 19 years old managing employees two to three times my age. 
                      Playing football my whole life I gave out ass whoopings on the regular (it's true ask anyone) , but my 4 years in the car business taught me how to prosper on the recieving end of them. 
                      The infinite hours deposited month after month were murdering the inner calling for creation that was eating me away since I started producing music at 16. I got comfortable enough to peel out
                      and slip into something a little more sexy. Coding, Web Development and Online Marketing was a suprisingly seemless transition for me. I embraced the 6+ hours per day of blue light radiation and
                    and tutorial videos because I became obsessed like I usually do. For better or worse, I became the kind of person who would rather die than make excuses and forfeit growth. I'm persistent, 
                  passionate, self-driven, perceptive and hungry. The purpose of this website is to
                  showcase the tools under my belt for anyone who might need them. I'm adept in many different coding languages including HTML/CSS/JAVA Web Development. I have experience ghostwriting high engagement 
                  tweets and copywrighting for startups focused on conversions. I've just recently mastered Search Engine Optimization and Cold Email/Ad Campaigns as well.
